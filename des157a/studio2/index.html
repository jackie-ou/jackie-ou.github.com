				<h1>Student Community Center</h1>
				<p>
					This is one of the best buildings on campus. I am biased because my favorite class is also here, but it is a great location for all-around studying, hangout, and food. The bathrooms are clean and there is a choice for indoor and outdoor seating.
				</p>
				<p>
					Memorable Memory: Had a study group with students for summer calculus there and then bumped into the instructor while he was coming out of the coffee shop. He was carrying all the midterms and we were terrified.

				<h1>Peter J. Shields Library</h1>
				<p>
					This is the library and it has 4 stories including the basement, so finding a seat is always guaranteed. It is hard to give a one size fits all rating since there are so many rooms. The basement allows talking but has no phone service. The room in this picture is extremely quiet. The left side room is a good compromise.

				</p>
				<p>
					Memorable Memory: Stayed until midnight working on a CS assignment with my partner and had to bike home in the freezing night. That assignment was really long but we learned alot.

				<h1>Memorial Union</h1>
				<p>
					Also known as the MU, this building has super high traffic but is close to many food options and classes. People can talk, eat, and take naps too. It is extremely full around noon time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Memorable Memory: I drank boba and talked with my friend who I haven't seen since highschool.
