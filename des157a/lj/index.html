                        Up until reading <a href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099">Game Design UX Best Practices</a>, I took game mechanics for granted. Game designers take UI positions into consideration so that they can take advantage of it for monetization reasons such as store buttons, more apps, and ads. Although shady, this dark-UX practice has been proven to maximize revenues. I am glad that there are regulations in place that prevent abuse of this practice.

                        The tips on sliders being effective if it reveals partially visible items are helpful. Today in the feedback section, we were discussing how we could indicate interaction without explicitly stating it and I thought that this relates nicely to that. Another way to indicate interaction is to animate it from the triggering button.

                        An interesting psychological trick is to keep the buttons that involve user decisions and that are good for your game to be placed on the right side. Conversely, the options that are bad for the game should be kept on the left side. I think this goes back into the reachability of the average right hand user. This placement of the buttons makes it easier to reach the right side and therefore more likely to select the good option.

                        The picture that I selected for my read is of the interior of the Memorial Union. There are people in frame, some sitting down on the chairs and couches perhaps trying to study and others standing up getting ready to leave. It is interesting that they are all individually doing their own tasks but from the camera’s point of view, it looks like they are all collectively just students sitting together. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        This might be why the Memorial Union looks intimidating to find a seat to sit in since it seems like you are an outsider trying to enter the studying student’s group, but once you sit down it is very relaxing to stay in and you are actually detached and isolated from the group since everyone is minding their own business.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        I am a student so I often look for locations to study in. With how populated the Memorial Union is, it shows how extroverted I felt for the day if I chose to study there. Similarly, if I felt introverted for the day, I would likely avoid considering checking if the Memorial Union was available at all.

                        This is an image of Rohit at the beach. The background of the image has other beachgoers. Bokeh was applied to the background to keep Rohit centered and in focus. Being blurred in the background makes the actions of the beachgoers more mysterious since it is not entirely clear what they are doing. What’s obvious is that Rohit is happy and travelling to the beach since he took time to pose in the center of the frame and he is wearing a backpack. The footprints also have a unique interaction with the bokeh effect as it gradually fades and becomes more blurry as the footprints go further out in the distance.

                <h2 class="title">Using Images and Interaction to Inspire Visual Thinking</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://slowness.com/encyclopedia-of-the-farm/">Slow</a> is a website that serves as an encyclopedia of the farm, La Granja Ibiza. 
                        It communicates information using images and interactions similar to those from an editorial style. 
                        The images follow a pattern of varying in big sizing and small sizes with supplementary text. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Scrolling and hovering on the images cause text to fade and appear which demands focus in 
                        specific areas for the user. Every picture is animated so on top of the image’s contents itself,
                        it also shows how the contents of the farm change over time. The menu of the website and footer 
                        are also hidden out of view so that the images are the forefront of focus.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        An important takeaway is to question why the designer chose to use pictures as the primary
                        medium. Telling readers about a farm is far less interesting than showing them. Also having
                        the pictures span across and animate provides immersion for the viewer.

                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        This week I read <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>. 
                        Up until now, I’ve never known the official term for modals, I always referred 
                        to it as windows. The main role of a modal is to grab the user’s attention by providing 
                        additional information or requesting user input. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Careful design must be practiced when implementing a modal because it can be jarring 
                        if used wrong. For instance, the sizing could either be too big or too small which makes 
                        the content hard to view. This problem is exacerbated when applied in mobile devices. 
                        Using the lightbox effect helps focus the content that is intended for the user to interact with.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        In addition to the tips listed above, the key to a good modal is having: an escape hatch, 
                        descriptive title, and good button names. This is universally true for any visual design, 
                        so I agree with that.  Avoid having modals popup automatically and have it pop up after a 
                        button is clicked, following a link, or selecting an option to trigger the modal. This tip 
                        is especially important because users usually associated automatic pop ups as malicious.

                <h2 class="title">Best Practices for Form Design Response</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        For the Studio 1a - Mad Libs 2.0 - Reading & Response Learning Journal assignment, 
                        I was tasked to read <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>. As I was taking notes for it, 
                        most of the tips were obvious once stated, but it never crossed my mind before reading it. 
                        Tips like maintaining a vertical layout for columns so that it doesn’t interrupt the user’s 
                        eye movement momentum seemed very logical. Putting hints and labels outside of the input field 
                        so that when the user clicks on it, the message won’t disappear was a technique I took for granted too. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I realized that there was a huge connection between designing user experience and psychology. 
                        I never considered that the user may want to stop filling out the form due to confusion, fatigue, or not being 
                        ready. Consideration of the user at the macro-level proved to be just as essential as the design on the web page
                        itself. My favorite tip regarding psychology was opting for asking easier questions at the beginning of the form
                        which causes the user to feel invested and therefore become more likely to finish the form.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Finally, the reading touched on input validation and response which I am familiar with since I come 
                        from a computer science background. Making the buttons disable after the first click is very important
                        because in some cases sending data multiple times can be catastrophic. Also providing nice and useful 
                        error messages are great for helping the user finish the form without guessing what to do.
                    </p>

                        This is the link for checking out your shopping cart: <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/delivery">Addidas</a>. 
                        You need to add something in your cart to be able to see the form.
                        My favorite thing about their solution to inline form labels is 
                        when you click on it, the label moves upwards instead of disappearing.
