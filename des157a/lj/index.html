                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        This week I read <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>. 
                        Up until now, I’ve never known the official term for modals, I always referred 
                        to it as windows. The main role of a modal is to grab the user’s attention by providing 
                        additional information or requesting user input. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Careful design must be practiced when implementing a modal because it can be jarring 
                        if used wrong. For instance, the sizing could either be too big or too small which makes 
                        the content hard to view. This problem is exacerbated when applied in mobile devices. 
                        Using the lightbox effect helps focus the content that is intended for the user to interact with.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        In addition to the tips listed above, the key to a good modal is having: an escape hatch, 
                        descriptive title, and good button names. This is universally true for any visual design, 
                        so I agree with that.  Avoid having modals popup automatically and have it pop up after a 
                        button is clicked, following a link, or selecting an option to trigger the modal. This tip 
                        is especially important because users usually associated automatic pop ups as malicious.

                <h2 class="title">Best Practices for Form Design Response</h2>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        For the Studio 1a - Mad Libs 2.0 - Reading & Response Learning Journal assignment, 
                        I was tasked to read <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>. As I was taking notes for it, 
                        most of the tips were obvious once stated, but it never crossed my mind before reading it. 
                        Tips like maintaining a vertical layout for columns so that it doesn’t interrupt the user’s 
                        eye movement momentum seemed very logical. Putting hints and labels outside of the input field 
                        so that when the user clicks on it, the message won’t disappear was a technique I took for granted too. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I realized that there was a huge connection between designing user experience and psychology. 
                        I never considered that the user may want to stop filling out the form due to confusion, fatigue, or not being 
                        ready. Consideration of the user at the macro-level proved to be just as essential as the design on the web page
                        itself. My favorite tip regarding psychology was opting for asking easier questions at the beginning of the form
                        which causes the user to feel invested and therefore become more likely to finish the form.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <p>
                        Finally, the reading touched on input validation and response which I am familiar with since I come 
                        from a computer science background. Making the buttons disable after the first click is very important
                        because in some cases sending data multiple times can be catastrophic. Also providing nice and useful 
                        error messages are great for helping the user finish the form without guessing what to do.

                        You need to add something in your cart to be able to see the form.
                        My favorite thing about their solution to inline form labels is 
                        when you click on it, the label moves upwards instead of disappearing.
