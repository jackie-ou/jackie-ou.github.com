                    For the Studio 1a - Mad Libs 2.0 - Reading & Response Learning Journal assignment, 
                    I was tasked to read <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>. As I was taking notes for it, 
                    most of the tips were obvious once stated, but it never crossed my mind before reading it. 
                    Tips like maintaining a vertical layout for columns so that it doesn’t interrupt the user’s 
                    eye movement momentum seemed very logical. Putting hints and labels outside of the input field 
                    so that when the user clicks on it, the message won’t disappear was a technique I took for granted too.

                    Furthermore, I realized that there was a huge connection between designing user experience and psychology. 
                    I never considered that the user may want to stop filling out the form due to confusion, fatigue, or not being 
                    ready. Consideration of the user at the macro-level proved to be just as essential as the design on the web page
                     itself. My favorite tip regarding psychology was opting for asking easier questions at the beginning of the form
                      which causes the user to feel invested and therefore become more likely to finish the form.

                    Finally, the reading touched on input validation and response which I am familiar with since I come 
                    from a computer science background. Making the buttons disable after the first click is very important
                     because in some cases sending data multiple times can be catastrophic. Also providing nice and useful 
                     error messages are great for helping the user finish the form without guessing what to do.

                    This is the link for checking out your shopping cart: <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/delivery">Addidas</a>. 
                    You need to add something in your cart to be able to see the form.
                    My favorite thing about their solution to inline form labels is 
                    when you click on it, the label moves upwards instead of disappearing.
