                This game was a heavy inspiration for my dice design. I wanted it to show the user that it was spinning. The goal was to allow the user a feeling of control on the number of the dice thrown. There is a dice that rolls random numbers until the user stops it. Upon hitting the button, the dice stops spinning and the number that was last shown gets selected as the value. I really liked that there were instructions to remind the user on how to stop the roulette because if it weren’t for that then the game wouldn’t start until the user rolls.

                This game’s UI is simple but effective. The goal of the game is to move the cursor so that it does not touch the moving balloons to avoid popping them. Labels are in place that clearly indicate the score and amount of points accumulated. This game could’ve easily gone with merely dodging circles from the cursor, but the use of a needle as the cursor and balloons add an extra theme to the game which makes it more fun. I want to also add a narrative to my game so that there is a draw for the player to engage.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
            My goal for this project is to add functionality and improve the visual theme. I want the users to be drawn into the game via the aesthetics of how it looks as well as engage them with thoughtful mechanics of the game. It is similar to Mario Party since it shares a dice but the rolling animation and user choice is different. Similarly, it is like Don’t Pop the Balloons where the UI is simple but my game lacks a theme.

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                My design process will address the lack of a theme. I want to reconsider the color palette and use of images. I experimented with Adobe Colors to find colors that pair well with each other. The legibility of the text was an issue because of the previous color choices. Adding a theme will also make the game more visually appealing and provide a story to enhance the game.

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                I want the user to feel that their actions create an impact. The dice roll of the game is inherently random. By adding a button to control when to stop, the user can retain some semblance of control and feel that they earned the victory rather than winning by pure luck. I also want to implement an overlay to show the previous directions in case users forget. They can control when to be reminded of the directions so it does not have to be distracting.

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <div class="center">
            <p>
                Besides feeling in control of the game, I want users to have fun. If the game is not captivating and immersive, then either the game mechanics or my design is at fault. I want to limit that factor as small as possible.
