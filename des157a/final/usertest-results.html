                Users felt that there was a feeling of control when rolling the dice as opposed to pure luck. Players eventually figured out how to close the help window but it was not intuitive. The score's color and size make the text noticeable and much easier to read.

                I plan to make the directions overlay's closing much more intuitive. I also want to brush up some minor inconsistencies within the CSS and button's wording. Finally, I want to make the overlay itself more polished so that it properly hides the underlying game.

                He got the directions to show up but was confused on how to close the window. One of the tasks were to try to roll a 1 on purpose which he was able to do, so the speed of the dice moving is not too fast.

                Chueyi figured out how to close the game directions. He wanted the score to be more bold and the spacing between the buttons for quit and help to be more pronounced.

                Urvi managed to roll a one followed by snake eyes. She wanted the speed of the dice roll to increase but was satified with the text heirarchy.
