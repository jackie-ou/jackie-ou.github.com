    <h1>Key Observations</h1>
    <div class="observations">
        <h2>Add more context to project/drawing</h2>
        <p>One observation was that people were unsure of what to draw, even with the climate change slide. They thought that the prompt, “What does this scene look like in 50 years” could be more specific to prompt users to think about negative aspects of climate change rather than random future events.</p>

        <div class="center"><h2>Download confusion</h2></div>
        <p>Users thought that having clearer instructions through the download process would help smoothen the process. Some users were not aware of the download and did not know what to do after, while others ended up downloading multiple copies because they mistakenly navigated back and forth between the pages. </p>

        <div class="center"><h2>More drawing controls</h2></div>
        <p>One wish was for us to add color circles that are clickable and that shows the preview of the brush color. Another feature was to provide brush width options that allow for finer drawing and color filling. 	Users also thought that an undo function along with clear would be beneficial to remove mistakes while retaining good parts of their drawing.

        <div class="center"><h2>How to Update</h2></div>

            <p>To add more context about our project, we will update the Climate Change page with facts and statistics about climate change and reword some of the header and paragraph text for greater specificity.</p>
            <p>We also plan to add more drawing controls, like color, brush size, and undo, along the top or bottom of the canvas to allow more flexibility when users draw over the image.</p>
            <p>To resolve the download issue, we plan to add a download button so the user controls it manually rather than the browser triggering it automatically. If they click “Next” without downloading the photo, the following screen will say “Please go back and download the file”.</p>
