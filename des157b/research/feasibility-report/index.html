            <h2>Assessment</h2>
            <p>One of Darren's main concerns was that the project was daunting because of his current skill level in coding. Although the technology is new to me as well, I am confident that we can learn it. A concern is saving the image and drawing layer to display in a grid. I want to remove the download and upload step so that the user experience is more seamless.</p>
