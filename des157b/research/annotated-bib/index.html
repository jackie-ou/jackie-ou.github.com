                <p>
                    This article speaks on gender bias and how it can affect people on their thoughts of women being in technical fields. That bias against women shows the significance of schemas in today's society. To combat that, we need to have eternal vigilance and be patient to the glacial change of perceptions over time. In the technical field, it is important to remember when you look at job applicants, keep the consciousness of being impartial in mind. I can use this to follow ideas of anti discrimination, with a particular emphasis in gender bias and its impacts in the stem field.

                    This organization's about page is an example of something I want to do. Their goal is to equip the next generation with the tools of technology, thought, and leadership to improve the world, bit by bit. In particular, their summer program was to enable young females to get involved in coding because they are an underrepresented group in the STEM industry. I can use this to follow ideas of ways to present the material to new learners. They have a Google Drive that has HTML, CSS, and Javascript content so I can use that for inspiration if I choose to design my own curriculum.

                    I chose this blog because the author wants to inspire learners who have a passion for programming, by providing the audience with a source of new alternative knowledge. In terms of new alternative knowledge, Dan Luu (2012) views that “there's a desperate shortage of understandable explanation of technical topics.” Dan Luu writes his blogs with the intention of sharing his findings and knowledge to other similar minded learners in the community so they can become valuable assets of the community. I can use this to follow his blog's flow of covering various topics if I choose to cover them in breadth.
